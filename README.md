# DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CODE AS A ZIP FILE
# READ ME FIRST BEFORE DOWNLOADING

This repository will be used to practice both your git and Java skills. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT AS A ZIP FILE. Downloading it as a zip file will prevent the git commands from working properly.

Instead, you will fork and clone this repository according using git. For a refresher on git, feel free to refer back to you previous [GitHub Practice](https://github.com/auberonedu/github-intro.git).

Remember to fork before cloning! MAKE MANY COMMITS AS YOU WORK! 

## Instructions
Each file has comments with small tasks to perform. For each task, write an implementation and a small print statement to verify it works. Run the main method for the file after each task and check the output.

Most of these taks should be easy, but there will likely be some that ask you to use a method you haven't heard of or forgot the name of. Feel free to look these up. When you come across something you needed to look up, add it to the [toRefresh.md](toRefresh.md) file so you can remember to brush up on it.
